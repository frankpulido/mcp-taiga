# üìö Documentation Strategy for AI-Assisted Development

**Making Every Session Productive by Maintaining Comprehensive Context**

---

## üéØ **The Challenge**

AI assistants (like Warp AI) don't retain memory between sessions. Each conversation starts fresh, which means:

‚ùå **Without Documentation:**
- "What were we working on?"
- "What's the project structure?"
- "What have we already built?"
- **Result:** 10-15 minutes lost getting back up to speed

‚úÖ **With Documentation:**
- Read 2-3 key documents
- Instant understanding of project state
- Immediate productivity
- **Result:** Jump straight into coding/planning

---

## üìñ **Core Documentation Files**

These documents form the **memory system** for AI-assisted development:

### üè† **1. WARP.md** (or PROJECT_CONTEXT.md)
**Purpose:** AI-first project overview  
**When to update:** After major milestones or architectural changes  
**Contains:**
- Project purpose & goals
- Technology stack
- Key architectural decisions
- Current development phase
- Common commands & workflows
- Known issues & gotchas

**Why it matters:** This is the first document an AI reads to understand your project.

---

### üó∫Ô∏è **2. ROADMAP_WARP_FRANK.md** (or PROJECT_ROADMAP.md)
**Purpose:** Development journey & future plans  
**When to update:** After completing phases, at sprint boundaries  
**Contains:**
- ‚úÖ Completed phases (with dates & results)
- üöß Current work in progress
- üìã Planned future phases
- Lessons learned
- Success metrics

**Why it matters:** Shows what's been done and what's next, preventing redundant work.

---

### üìã **3. AGENT_TEAM_OVERVIEW.md** (or ARCHITECTURE.md)
**Purpose:** System components & their interactions  
**When to update:** When adding/modifying major components  
**Contains:**
- Component descriptions
- How pieces work together
- Visual architecture diagrams
- API/interface contracts

**Why it matters:** Helps AI understand how to extend or modify the system.

---

### üìö **4. README.md**
**Purpose:** Human-first project documentation  
**When to update:** After feature releases, for onboarding  
**Contains:**
- Quick start guide
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- Feature list
- Troubleshooting

**Why it matters:** Helps both humans and AI understand how to use the project.

---

### üìù **5. Phase Implementation Summaries**
**Purpose:** Detailed record of what was built  
**When to create:** After completing each major feature/phase  
**Format:** `PHASE_X.Y_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`  
**Contains:**
- What was built (code, files, lines)
- Test results
- Design decisions
- Lessons learned
- Before/after comparisons

**Why it matters:** Captures detailed context that's easy to forget.

---

## üîÑ **The Documentation Workflow**

### **During Development:**

## üéØ **Documentation Types for Different Needs**

### **For AI Assistants:**
- ‚úÖ `WARP.md` - Start here
- ‚úÖ `ROADMAP_WARP_FRANK.md` - Context
- ‚úÖ `AGENT_TEAM_OVERVIEW.md` - Architecture
- ‚úÖ Phase summaries - Details

### **For Human Developers:**
- ‚úÖ `README.md` - Getting started
- ‚úÖ `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design
- ‚úÖ Code comments - Implementation details

### **For Project Managers:**
- ‚úÖ `ROADMAP_WARP_FRANK.md` - Progress tracking
- ‚úÖ Phase summaries - Deliverables
- ‚úÖ `README.md` - Feature list

---

## üí° **Best Practices**

### ‚úÖ **DO:**

1. **Update documentation AS you code**
   - Don't wait until the end
   - Small, frequent updates are better than massive rewrites

2. **Use clear, scannable formatting**
   - Headers, bullets, tables
   - Visual diagrams when possible
   - Code examples with annotations

3. **Include dates and authors**
   - Track when things were added
   - Know who to ask for clarification

4. **Write for future you**
   - You'll forget details in 2 months
   - Document the "why", not just the "what"

5. **Keep it current**
   - Outdated docs are worse than no docs
   - Delete obsolete information

### ‚ùå **DON'T:**

1. **Don't write novels**
   - Be concise
   - Use bullet points
   - Link to details rather than embedding everything

2. **Don't duplicate information**
   - Single source of truth
   - Link between documents
   - Avoid copy-paste

3. **Don't skip the "why"**
   - Technical decisions need rationale
   - Future developers need context

4. **Don't forget visual aids**
   - ASCII diagrams
   - Flowcharts
   - Architecture maps

## üöÄ **Session Startup Checklist**

When starting a new AI-assisted session:

```bash
# 1. AI should read these files (in order):
1. WARP.md                      # Project overview
2. ROADMAP_WARP_FRANK.md        # Current state & history
3. README.md                    # Features & usage
4. Latest PHASE_*.md            # Recent work

# 2. Quick status check
$ git log --oneline -5          # Recent commits
$ git status                    # Current changes

# 3. You're ready to code! üöÄ
```

---

## üìä **Documentation Metrics**

Track these to ensure docs stay useful:

- **Last Updated:** Each doc should show when it was last modified
- **Completeness:** Do all major features have docs?
- **Accuracy:** Are docs still valid after code changes?
- **Usability:** Can someone new understand the project?

---

## üéÅ **Benefits You'll See**

### **Immediate:**
- ‚úÖ AI gets up to speed in 2-3 minutes instead of 15
- ‚úÖ No redundant questions about project structure
- ‚úÖ Faster feature development

### **Long-term:**
- ‚úÖ Easy onboarding for new team members
- ‚úÖ Historical context preserved
- ‚úÖ Better decision-making with documented rationale
- ‚úÖ Reduced "tribal knowledge" problems

### **For AI-Assisted Development Specifically:**
- ‚úÖ Consistent quality across sessions
- ‚úÖ AI can reference past decisions
- ‚úÖ Smoother handoffs between different AI assistants
- ‚úÖ Better code suggestions based on project patterns

---

## üîÆ **Advanced: Documentation Automation**

### **Future Possibilities:**

1. **Auto-generate from Git**
   ```bash
   # Generate changelog from commits
   git log --pretty=format:"%h - %s (%an, %ar)" > CHANGELOG.md
   ```

2. **Keep docs in sync with code**
   ```javascript
   // Use tools like:
   - JSDoc for API documentation
   - Storybook for component docs
   - Swagger for API specs
   ```

3. **AI-assisted doc updates**
   ```
   After each feature:
   "Update WARP.md to reflect the new CodeReviewGenerator capability"
   ```

---

## üéä **The Golden Rule**

> **"If you need to explain it to an AI, document it."**

Every time you find yourself explaining:
- Project structure
- Design decisions
- How something works
- Why you chose approach X over Y

**‚Üí Write it down. Future you (and future AI) will thank you.**

---

## üìù **Naming Convention for Project Documentation**

### **Standard File Names**

Every project following this documentation strategy MUST use these exact filenames:

#### **Core Documentation (Required)**

| File Name | Purpose | When to Create |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| `WARP.md` | AI-first project context | Day 1 of project |
| `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` | Development journey & planning | Day 1 of project |
| `README.md` | User-facing documentation | Day 1 of project |
| `README_dev.md` | Technical/architecture deep dive | When architecture solidifies |

**Note:** `DOCUMENTATION_STRATEGY.md` lives in the mcpTaiga project and applies to ALL projects.

#### **Phase Documentation (As Needed)**

| File Pattern | Purpose | When to Create |
|--------------|---------|----------------|
| `PHASE_0_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` | Setup & foundation | After Phase 0 |
| `PHASE_1_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` | First major phase | After Phase 1 |
| `PHASE_X_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` | Subsequent phases | After each phase |

**Numbering Convention:**
- Use `PHASE_0` for setup/foundation
- Use `PHASE_1`, `PHASE_2`, etc. for main development phases
- Use `PHASE_X.Y` for sub-phases (e.g., `PHASE_3.1`, `PHASE_3.2`)

#### **Optional Documentation (Project-Specific)**

| File Name | Purpose | When to Create |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Detailed system design | For complex architectures |
| `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` | API endpoints & contracts | When building APIs |
| `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` | Production deployment steps | Before first deployment |
| `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` | Common issues & solutions | As issues are discovered |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Version history | After first release |

---

### **Naming Rules**

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Use `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.md` for documentation files
- Be consistent across all projects
- Use descriptive names that explain purpose
- Include `SUMMARY` in phase completion documents

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Use `camelCase` or `kebab-case` for core docs
- Create custom names for core documents
- Abbreviate file names (e.g., don't use `DOC.md`)
- Mix naming conventions within a project

---

### **Directory Structure**

```
project-root/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WARP.md                              # AI context (required)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PROJECT_ROADMAP.md                   # Planning (required)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                            # User docs (required)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README_dev.md                        # Tech docs (recommended)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PHASE_0_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md    # Setup phase
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PHASE_1_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md    # Development phases
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                                # Optional: detailed docs
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ARCHITECTURE.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ API_DOCUMENTATION.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [project files...]
```

---

### **Template Checklist**

When starting a new project, create these files in order:

```bash
# 1. Core documentation (copy from template project or mcpTaiga examples)
cp ../mcpTaiga/WARP.md ./WARP.md
cp ../mcpTaiga/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md ./PROJECT_ROADMAP.md  

# 2. Customize for your project
vim WARP.md              # Update project context
vim PROJECT_ROADMAP.md   # Define phases

# 3. Create README files
vim README.md            # User documentation
vim README_dev.md        # Technical details

# 4. After Phase 0 completion
vim PHASE_0_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
```
