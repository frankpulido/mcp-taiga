# 👤 Author-to-User Assignment Feature

**Automatic task assignment based on git commit authors**

---

## 🎯 **The Feature**

When generating tasks from git history, the Universal Taiga Agent now **automatically assigns tasks to the appropriate team member** by matching git commit authors with Taiga project members.

---

## ✨ **How It Works**

### **1. Git Commits Contain Author Info**
```bash
$ git log --pretty=format:"%h|%ad|%s|%an"
abc123|2025-10-07|Implement RoadmapGenerator|Frank Pulido
```

### **2. Agent Fetches Project Members**
When executing task generation, the agent:
1. Retrieves all Taiga project members
2. Stores member info (ID, username, full name, email)

### **3. Smart Author Matching**
The agent matches git authors to Taiga users by:
- **Exact match** on full name
- **Exact match** on username
- **Exact match** on email
- **Partial match** (author name contains member name, or vice versa)

### **4. Task Assignment**
If a match is found:
- Task's `assigned_to` field is set to the Taiga user ID
- Console shows: `✅ Created task: Feature X (assigned to Frank Pulido)`

If no match is found:
- Task is created unassigned
- Console shows: `✅ Created task: Feature X`

## 📊 **Example Workflow**

### **Git Commit:**
```
Author: Frank Pulido <frankpulido@me.com>
Date: 2025-10-07
Message: Implement RoadmapGenerator
```

### **Taiga Project Members:**
```
1. Frank Pulido (frankpulido) - frankpulido@me.com
2. John Doe (johndoe) - john@example.com
3. Jane Smith (janesmith) - jane@example.com
```

### **Result:**
```
✅ Created task: Implement RoadmapGenerator (assigned to Frank Pulido)
```

The task appears in Taiga with:
- ✅ Status: Done
- 👤 Assigned to: Frank Pulido
- 📅 Date: 2025-10-07
- 📝 Description: Includes commit details

---

## 🔍 **Matching Logic**

The `findUserByAuthor()` method uses intelligent fallback strategies:

### **Strategy 1: Solo Team Member (Auto-Assign)**
```javascript
// If project has only ONE team member
if (projectMembers.length === 1) {
  return projectMembers[0].id;  // ✅ Auto-assign to sole member
}
```

**Result:** In solo projects, **ALL tasks are automatically assigned to you**, regardless of:
- Whether the task has an author
- Whether the author matches your name
- Whether the task came from git, roadmap, or code review

### **Strategy 2: Author Matching (Multi-Member Teams)**
```javascript
// Git author: "Frank Pulido"
// Taiga member: { full_name: "Frank Pulido", username: "frankpulido", email: "frank@..." }

// Matches tried (in order):
1. full_name === "frank pulido" ✅ MATCH!
2. username === "frank pulido"
3. email === "frank pulido"
4. "frank pulido".includes("frank pulido")
5. full_name.includes("frank pulido")
```

**Case-insensitive** - All matching is done in lowercase.

## 🎁 **Benefits**

### **For Team Projects:**
- ✅ **Proper attribution** - Everyone gets credit for their work
- ✅ **Task ownership** - Clear who did what
- ✅ **Historical tracking** - See who worked on each feature
- ✅ **Workload visibility** - Understand team member contributions

### **For Solo Projects:**
- ✅ **All tasks auto-assigned** - If you're the only team member, ALL tasks are assigned to you
- ✅ **No manual work needed** - Even tasks from code review or roadmap parsing
- ✅ **Clean project board** - Everything has an owner
- ✅ **Works without git** - Doesn't require matching author names

### **For Multi-Contributor Projects:**
- ✅ **External contributors tracked** - If they're added to Taiga
- ✅ **Mixed assignments** - Different tasks assigned to different people
- ✅ **Collaboration visibility** - See who did what across the team

---

## ⚠️ **Edge Cases**

### **Author Not in Taiga Project:**
```
Git author: "External Contributor"
Taiga members: Frank, John, Jane
Result: Task created UNASSIGNED
```
**Solution:** Add the external contributor to your Taiga project first.

### **Multiple Authors with Similar Names:**
```
Git: "Frank P"
Taiga: "Frank Pulido", "Frank Parker"
Result: Matches first one found ("Frank Pulido")
```
**Solution:** Use full names in git commits (`git config user.name "Frank Pulido"`)

### **Author Email vs Full Name:**
```
Git author: "frankpulido@me.com"
Taiga email: "frankpulido@me.com"
Result: ✅ MATCHES (exact email match)
```

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Files Modified:**

1. **`src/taigaService.js`**
   - Added `getProjectMembers(projectId)` method
   - Fetches member details from Taiga API

2. **`agents/TaskGenerators/BaseGenerator.js`**
   - Added `findUserByAuthor(author)` method
   - Added `getUserName(userId)` helper method
   - Modified task creation to include `assigned_to` field
   - Fetches project members before task generation

3. **`agents/TaskGenerators/GitHistoryGenerator.js`**
   - Added `author` field to all generated tasks
   - Passes author info from commits

---

## 📝 **API Usage**

### **Creating Assigned Task:**
```javascript
await taigaService.createUserStory({
  project: 1234,
  subject: "Implement Feature X",
  description: "...",
  status: 5,
  tags: ["feature"],
  assigned_to: 567  // ← User ID from author matching
});
```

### **Matching Author:**
```javascript
const assignedTo = this.findUserByAuthor("Frank Pulido");
// Returns: 567 (Taiga user ID) or null
```

---

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

### **1. Use Consistent Git Author Names**
```bash
# Set globally
git config --global user.name "Frank Pulido"
git config --global user.email "frankpulido@me.com"

# Verify
git config user.name
```

### **2. Match Taiga Profile Names**
Ensure your Taiga full name matches your git author name:
- Git: "Frank Pulido"
- Taiga: "Frank Pulido" ✅

### **3. Add Team Members to Taiga**
Before running the agent, ensure all git contributors are:
- Added to the Taiga project
- Have matching names/emails

### **4. For External Contributors**
If enhancing someone else's project:
- Tasks from their commits won't be assigned (unless they're in your Taiga)
- Your new commits will be assigned to you
- **This is expected behavior!**

---

## 🧪 **Testing**

To test the feature:

```bash
# 1. Check your git author
git log --pretty=format:"%an" | head -5

# 2. Run the agent
node start-agent.js

# 3. Watch for assignment messages
✅ Created task: Fix bug (assigned to Frank Pulido)
✅ Created task: Add feature (assigned to John Doe)  
✅ Created task: External commit   # No assignment message = unassigned
```

---

## 🎊 **Real-World Example**

### **mcpTAIGA Project (this project):**

```
Git commits:
- Frank Pulido: 15 commits
- Warp AI Assistant: 0 commits (not a git user)
- adriaPedralbes: 5 commits (original author)

Taiga Project Members:
- Frank Pulido ✅

Result:
- 15 tasks assigned to Frank Pulido
- 5 tasks unassigned (adriaPedralbes not in project)
- Perfect! External work tracked but not assigned
```

---

## 💡 **Future Enhancements**

Potential improvements:

- 🔮 **Email regex matching** - Match "frank@company.com" to "frank@personal.com"
- 🔮 **Fuzzy name matching** - "F. Pulido" matches "Frank Pulido"
- 🔮 **Co-author support** - Parse `Co-authored-by:` trailer
- 🔮 **Author mapping file** - Manual author → user mappings
- 🔮 **Assignment override** - CLI flag to assign all tasks to specific user

---

## 📊 **Impact**

**Before:** Tasks created with no ownership  
**After:** Tasks automatically assigned to the right people

**Result:** Better project visibility, proper attribution, clearer accountability! 👥✨
