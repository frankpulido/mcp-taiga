# Universal Taiga Project Agent Roadmap

**Created:** October 7, 2025  
**Author:** Frank & Warp AI Assistant  
**Project:** mcpTAIGA Evolution Journey

---

## 🌟 **Vision Statement**

Transform project management from manual task creation to **intelligent, automated project organization** that understands your development history, predicts your needs, and structures your work intelligently across any technology stack.

---

## 📖 **The Evolution Story**

### **Phase 0: The Problem** 
*"I have great documentation but poor project organization"*

**Context:**
- Sophisticated AppointmentManager project with excellent architecture
- Rich git history showing thoughtful development evolution  
- Comprehensive Notion documentation with decision rationale
- Empty Taiga project with no structure or context

**Pain Points:**
- Manual task creation is tedious and error-prone
- Historical work context gets lost
- No connection between git history and project management
- Each new project requires starting from zero

---

## 🚀 **Development Phases**

### **✅ Phase 1: Single Project Population** *(Completed: October 6, 2025)*

#### **The Breakthrough Moment**
Frank: *"Yesterday you created a script to populate a specific Taiga project using an MCP named mcpTaiga"*

#### **What We Built:**
- `populate_taiga.js` - AppointmentManager-specific population script
- **Git History Mapping**: 83 commits → 8 phase epics + future tasks
- **Strategic Context Integration**: Combined PROJECT_ROADMAP.md + CODE_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md
- **Intelligent Status Assignment**: Git history = "Done", Future work = "New"

#### **Results Achieved:**
```
✅ 8 Epic User Stories Created (Phases 1-6 + Infrastructure)
✅ 7 Future Tasks with Proper Prioritization  
✅ Complete Git History Context Preserved
✅ Rich Descriptions with Technical Rationale
```

#### **Key Insights Discovered:**
- **Observer Pattern Excellence**: Sophisticated slot management architecture
- **Strategic Security Model**: Dual frontend (JSON + API) architecture
- **Healthcare Domain Expertise**: E.164 formats, appointment buffers
- **Evolution Through Exploration**: Multiple JSON persistence approaches tried

---

### **✅ Phase 2: Universal Agent Architecture** *(Completed: October 7, 2025)*

#### **The Vision Expansion**
Frank: *"Should be just TaigaPopulator... We can create one script for different situations... it would be nice to improve this MCP using an agent..."*

#### **Architectural Revolution:**
Transformed from **single-use script** → **universal project agent**

```
🎯 OLD: class AppointmentManagerTaigaPopulator
🚀 NEW: class TaigaProjectAgent + Modular Architecture
```

#### **What We Built:**

##### **🤖 Agent Core:**
- `TaigaProjectAgent.js` - Interactive orchestrator with discovery flow
- `ProjectDiscovery.js` - Auto-detect project types (Laravel, React, Node, Python)
- `GitAnalyzer.js` - Universal git history analysis with phase detection

##### **🏭 Task Generation Framework:**
```
TaskGenerators/
├── BaseGenerator.js         # Common functionality & patterns
├── GitHistoryGenerator.js   # Git → Taiga task conversion
├── ✅ RoadmapGenerator.js   # Roadmap → Taiga task conversion
├── [Future] FigmaGenerator.js
└── [Future] CodeReviewGenerator.js
```

##### **🧠 Intelligence Features:**
- **Smart Project Detection**: Framework-aware task suggestions
- **Multi-Source Integration**: Git + Roadmap + Code Review + Figma
- **Interactive Discovery**: Asks the right questions per project type
- **Preview & Confirmation**: No surprises, full user control
- **Rate-Limited Execution**: Respects API constraints

##### **🆕 Project Creation Capability:** *(Added: October 7, 2025)*
Frank: *"I think that the Universal Taiga MCP Agent should also offer the Taiga project creation"*

- **Interactive Project Creation**: Name, description, privacy settings
- **Smart Defaults**: Kanban template, appropriate initial configuration
- **Seamless Integration**: Create → Populate in single workflow
- **URL Generation**: Automatic project link display

##### **🔄 MCP Server Lifecycle Management:** *(Added: October 7, 2025)*
Frank: *"do you check that the mcp server is started? if it's not you should take care of it (npm start)"*

- **Health Checking**: Automatic server status detection
- **User-Controlled Startup**: Asks permission before auto-starting
- **Manual Instructions**: Clear guide for manual startup if preferred
- **Smart Cleanup**: Offers to stop server if agent started it
- **Verification**: Confirms server is running before proceeding

##### **📚 Comprehensive Documentation:** *(Added: October 7, 2025)*
Frank: *"I renamed README.md as README_ORIGINAL.md - It seems we need a README_NEW_2025_10_07.md"*

- **Professional README.md**: Complete rewrite with attractive formatting
- **Real-World Examples**: AppointmentManager success story
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Visual system design explanation
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions
- **Contributing Guidelines**: How to extend the agent
- **GitHub Integration Guide**: `GITHUB Taiga setup.md` for commit automation

#### **Universal Questions Framework:**
```javascript
Essential: Project dir, Taiga credentials, Target project
Conditional: Git analysis? Roadmap parsing? Figma integration?
Framework-Specific: Laravel policies? React components? Test coverage?
Server Management: Auto-start server? Stop after completion?
```

#### **Meta-Achievement Unlocked:**
🎉 **Successfully used the Universal Agent to manage its own development!**
