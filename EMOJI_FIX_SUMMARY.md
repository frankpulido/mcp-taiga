# 🔧 Emoji Issue Fix - Summary

**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Issue:** Taiga API returned 500 errors for user stories with emoji characters in titles  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

## 🐛 **The Problem**

During the first population run, 4 user stories failed with HTTP 500 errors:

```
Failed to create user story 🏭 Task Generation Framework: **
Failed to create user story 🆕 Project Creation Capability: ** *(Added: October 7, 2025)*
Failed to create user story 🔄 MCP Server Lifecycle Management: ** *(Added: October 7, 2025)*
Failed to create user story 📚 Comprehensive Documentation: ** *(Added: October 7, 2025)*
```

**Root Cause:** Emoji Unicode characters in titles were not accepted by Taiga's API.

---

## ✅ **The Solution**

### **1. Enhanced `sanitizeTitle()` Method**

Updated `agents/TaskGenerators/RoadmapGenerator.js` with comprehensive emoji removal:

```javascript
sanitizeTitle(title) {
  // Comprehensive Unicode emoji regex covering all ranges
  const emojiRegex = /[\u{1F300}-\u{1F9FF}\u{2600}-\u{26FF}\u{2700}-\u{27BF}...]/gu;
  
  return title
    .replace(emojiRegex, '')              // Remove ALL emojis
    .replace(/\[[ xX]\]/gi, '')            // Remove checkboxes
    .replace(/\*\*(.+?)\*\*/g, '$1')       // Remove bold
    .replace(/\*(.+?)\*/g, '$1')           // Remove italic
    .replace(/`(.+?)`/g, '$1')             // Remove code marks
    .replace(/\s+/g, ' ')                  // Normalize spaces
    .replace(/^[:*\s]+|[:*\s]+$/g, '')     // Trim special chars
    .trim()
    .slice(0, 100);                        // Taiga limit
}
```

### **2. Applied Sanitization to All Extraction Methods**

- ✅ `extractPhases()` - Epic titles
- ✅ `extractFeatures()` - User Story titles  
- ✅ `extractTodoItems()` - Task titles

### **3. Created Retry Script**

`retry-failed-items.js` - Successfully created the 4 previously failed items with clean titles:

```
✅ Created: Task Generation Framework
✅ Created: Project Creation Capability (Added: October 7, 2025)
✅ Created: MCP Server Lifecycle Management (Added: October 7, 2025)
✅ Created: Comprehensive Documentation (Added: October 7, 2025)
```

## 🧪 **Testing**

Verified with `test-roadmap-generator.js`:

```
✅ Epics (Phases): 9
   - Titles now: "Phase 1: Single Project Population* (Completed: October 6, 2025)"
   - Previously: "Phase 1: Single Project Population** *(Completed: October 6, 2025)*"

✅ User Stories (Features): 15
   - Titles now: "Task Generation Framework"
   - Previously: "🏭 Task Generation Framework: **"

✅ Tasks (Action Items): 20
   - All properly sanitized
```
